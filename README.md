# CS3353-Project4 - Solve A System of Linear Equations

##Overview
- The project mainly consists of two parts:
    - Compare Trivial (Gaussian Elimination) and Robust (Gauss-Seidel method): solve Ax = b where A, x, b are matrices
    - Introduce three new methods: Jacobi iterative method, Successive over-relaxation, and Thomas algorithm. Solve a more specific numeric problem: a second order differential equation.
